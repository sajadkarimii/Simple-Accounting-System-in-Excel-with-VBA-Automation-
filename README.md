This is a simple accounting system built entirely in Excel using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for automation.
The goal of this project is to organize and manage small business financial data — including products, purchases, sales, and expenses — all within one Excel file.

📊 Sheets Included:

Products Entry Sheet: used to enter new products into the system.

Products Data Sheet: stores all product information automatically after entry.

Purchase Sheet: used to record new purchases.

Purchase List Sheet: displays the list of all purchase records.

Sales Sheet: used to register product sales.

Sales List Sheet: contains a complete list of all sales.

Expenses Sheet: used to input expenses.

Expenses List Sheet: stores and displays all expense records.

All interactions between sheets are automated using VBA (VBS) scripts, making data entry and management faster and reducing manual errors.

💡 Future Improvements / Ideas

If you want to improve or expand the project, here are some good next steps:

📈 Add dashboard visualization – create charts that show sales, profit, and expenses dynamically.

💾 Add automatic backup system – save daily copies of the file automatically with date/time.

🔐 Add a login system – restrict access with a simple password form in VBA.

🔄 Connect to external database (e.g., Access or SQLite) – to handle larger datasets safely.

📤 Export reports to PDF – automatically generate and export daily or monthly financial reports.
